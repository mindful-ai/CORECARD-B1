Few programming languages provide direct support for graphs as a data type, and Python is no exception. 
However, graphs are easily built out of lists and dictionaries. For instance, here's a simple graph

    A -> B
    A -> C
    B -> C
    B -> D
    C -> D
    D -> C
    E -> F
    F -> C

This graph has six nodes (A-F) and eight arcs. It can be represented by the following Python data structure:

graph = {'A': ['B', 'C'],
             'B': ['C', 'D'],
             'C': ['D'],
             'D': ['C'],
             'E': ['F'],
             'F': ['C']}
